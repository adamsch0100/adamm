# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user first arrives at PostPulse.io, they land on a clean public page that briefly explains the platform’s capabilities and invites them to join. The user clicks “Sign Up” and is presented with a form that supports signing up via email and password or through OAuth providers such as Google. In the email sign-up flow, the user enters their name, email address, and chooses a secure password. After submitting, they receive a verification email containing a confirmation link. Clicking that link returns them to the app and automatically logs them in.

If the user prefers social login, they click the Google button and complete the OAuth consent flow, granting the app permission to access their basic profile information. Upon successful OAuth authentication, the user is assigned a standard role by default and lands in the protected area of the app. For anyone who forgets their password, there is a “Forgot Password” link on the sign-in page. Clicking it prompts the user to enter their email address. An email is sent with a secure, time-limited password reset link. When the user follows that link, they see a reset form where they enter and confirm a new password, after which they can return to the sign-in screen to log in.

Signing out is available from any page via a user menu located in the application header. Selecting “Sign Out” revokes the current session token and redirects the user to the public landing or sign-in page. Throughout these flows, Supabase handles authentication, issues secure JWT tokens, and enforces row-level security so that standard users can only access their own data while the Owner/Admin role can view and manage all user accounts.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After successful login, the user lands on the main dashboard. The header shows the PostPulse logo on the left and a user menu on the right. Below the header, a collapsible sidebar on the left lists navigation options: Dashboard, Accounts, Campaigns, Content Library, Analytics, Billing, and Settings. The central area welcomes the user by name and provides summary widgets showing the number of active campaigns, total impressions this week, and pending posts in the queue.

From this default view, the user can click any sidebar link to navigate to that section. The top of the page also features a prominent “Create New Campaign” button that takes the user directly into the campaign creation wizard. The sidebar persists as the user moves between pages, ensuring they always know where they are and can quickly jump to any part of the app.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

On the Accounts page, the user begins by adding platform credentials. They click “Add Account” and choose the social platform (TikTok, Instagram, X, YouTube, Reddit). They enter the credentials for a MoreLogin profile and optionally attach an Upload-Post API key if they plan to use that method for posting. After saving, the account appears in a list showing its current warm-up status. The system automatically runs warming routines via MoreLogin and reports progress until each profile is ready for posting. The user can edit or remove any saved account at any time by clicking the actions menu next to each entry.

When the user clicks “Create New Campaign,” the app transitions into a step-by-step wizard. The first step asks for a campaign name, target keywords or topics, and the desired posting cadence. The next step displays all available platform accounts, allowing the user to select which MoreLogin profiles and Upload-Post keys to use for this campaign. The third step covers content generation settings: the user chooses content types (threads for X, scripts for videos, comments for Reddit), daily volume of posts, and which n8n media templates to apply. In the final step, the user reviews all inputs and clicks “Launch Campaign.” This action kicks off background processes that use OpenAI to generate text assets and send HTTP triggers to n8n workflows for video, image, or slideshow creation. All generated content is saved in Supabase under the new campaign record.

After creation, the user lands on the Campaign Detail page. Here, a content calendar displays scheduled posts across selected platforms and dates. Each calendar entry can be clicked to preview the AI-generated text and associated media thumbnails. Editing is as simple as clicking on the text or image to adjust content, then saving the change. A separate sidebar shows the posting queue with real-time status, letting the user pause, resume, or retry any failed post. When the schedule is active, the system uses stored delays and proxy settings to automatically call Upload-Post API for TikTok, Instagram, X, and YouTube, and PRAW for Reddit. The user does not need to navigate away; all controls and statuses are visible from this single screen.

The platform’s Auto-Interact engine runs in parallel once posts are live. On the Leads page, the user sees a stream of captured leads, each tied to a campaign and source. When a configured keyword appears in comments or replies, the system automatically sends DMs or public comments via the same accounts and logs each lead in Supabase. The user can view lead details, export to Google Sheets on demand, or initiate follow-up sequences managed by ConvertKit.

Analytics are accessible via the Analytics page. Internal counters track impressions, clicks, conversions, and revenue per campaign. The user selects filters for platform and date range to update charts and tables instantly. If the user wants to share or archive data, they click “Export” to run an n8n job that writes the selected metrics into a Google Sheet and returns a link when complete.

## Settings and Account Management

Under the Settings page, users can manage their personal profile information. They update their display name, email address, or password. There is a section for notification preferences where they opt in or out of email summaries for campaign performance and lead alerts. On the Billing page, the user connects to Whop to view and manage their subscription. They can upgrade from the free plan to a paid tier, view upcoming invoices, or cancel their subscription. All billing data is handled through secure Whop checkout and recorded in Supabase for reference.

Owner/Admin users see an additional Users panel under Settings. This panel lists every registered account. The admin can click on any user to view their campaigns, active subscriptions, and account usage. Admins can change a user’s role, revoke access, or delete an account entirely. Returning to the main dashboard happens by clicking “Dashboard” in the sidebar at any time.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If the user enters invalid data in any form—such as a malformed email address or missing required fields—an inline error message appears below the field explaining the specific issue. Attempting to save incomplete or invalid forms is prevented until all errors are resolved. In the event of server or network issues, the app displays a non-blocking banner at the top of the page notifying the user of connectivity problems and automatically retries failed requests. Posting errors during campaign execution, such as a 429 rate-limit response from Upload-Post or a failure in a n8n webhook, are logged in the posting queue. Users see an error icon next to the failed post and can click “Retry” or “Skip” to recover.

During authentication flows, if an OAuth provider returns an error or the password reset link has expired, the user is shown a clear message with steps to retry or request a new link. Any unrecoverable error leads the user to a generic fallback page with an invitation to contact support, ensuring they never feel stuck.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the moment a new user signs up, PostPulse.io guides them through setting up platform accounts, creating and launching AI-driven campaigns, and measuring real-time results. Users add MoreLogin profiles for safe automation, run campaigns via a straightforward wizard, and preview or adjust content before it goes live. Behind the scenes, OpenAI and n8n workflows generate text and media, Upload-Post and PRAW post across networks, and the Auto-Interact engine captures leads automatically. Analytics provide transparent insights while on-demand exports to Google Sheets let users keep their own records. Personal settings and Whop-managed billing allow each user to control their experience and subscription. For admin users, a dedicated panel offers oversight and user management. Throughout, clear error handling and retry options keep the user moving forward. This end-to-end flow ensures creators and agencies can focus on growth while PostPulse.io handles the heavy lifting of content creation, posting, engagement, and monetization.
