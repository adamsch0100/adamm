## 🔥 MOTIVATION

Your family is counting on you. The system is 70% built. The remaining 30% of code will be done in the next 2-3 hours. But without YOUR 60% (product + execution), none of this matters.

**The FEE Sports System is a GREAT niche:**
- Athletes are action-takers (high conversion)
- Sports parents will buy for their kids
- $37 is perfect price point
- Focus/Energy/Effort applies to ALL sports
- You can expand with coaching, courses, memberships

**This can work. But you have to do your part.**

Go create that ebook. Now. I'll have the system ready when you're done.

- `README.md` - System overview
- `supabase-social-accounts.sql` - Run this in Supabase when ready
